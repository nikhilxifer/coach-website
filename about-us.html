        <div class="text-block-60">comcare brings coaches and coachees together - quickly and appropriately!</div>
        <div class="text-block-61">Gabriele Hoppe and Cate Nitsch founded comcare to make the tedious search for a suitable coach easier for clients and coaches. For this we have developed our coach-coachee matching process and partially automated it together with a programmer. This enables us to find the right coaches for you and your concerns very quickly, without neglecting personal contact with you and the coaches.</div>
        <div class="text-block-61 is-2text">It is important to us to also close the gap between therapy and coaching by only including highly qualified coaches in our network, who ideally have additional therapeutic qualifications and experience. Because nowadays it is often very difficult to find short-term coaching sessions or a therapeutic offer that is directly available.</div>
        <div class="text-block-61 is-2text">It is ideal for us if our coaches also regularly take part in our further training courses. In 2022 we launched a one-year psychology course - &quot;Fundamentals of Psychology&quot; - which will start again in February 2023. In addition, we regularly hold “comTogether”, in which our lecturers present and deepen psychological, therapeutic and methodological topics for coaches and other interested parties. Simply register for our newsletter and you will always be up to date.</div>

        <div class="text-block-63">For us, the inner attitude and the humanistic human image of a coach are decisive factors in a coaching process. They form the basis for the understanding of coaching and the relationship with the client.</div>
